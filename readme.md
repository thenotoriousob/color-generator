### Project Enhancements

- Added the copy to clipboard tooltip, this then changes to Copied if the user clicks,
  then reverts back when they mouse off
  *** The copy to clipboard functionality doesn't appear to work in Scrimba though
- Added a hover effect to the color block that makes it slightly bigger
- Added a box shadow hover to the picker, select and button


### Code  Structure
- I was having trouble with my event listeners when using Template Literals and updating
  innerHtml inside the loop, so I changed to having the html template that I could clone in the JS
- I went for the async/await just because I thought it made it clearer that the renderColors function
  was getting called from there, rather than being lost in the .thens

Thank you for your time.
